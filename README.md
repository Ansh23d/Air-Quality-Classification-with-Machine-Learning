# Air-Quality-Classification-with-Machine-Learning
This project demonstrates a multi-class classification solution for predicting air quality levels using a pollution dataset. The project explores two machine learning models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—to analyze and predict the target variable (Air Quality).
